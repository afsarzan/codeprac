Below is a concise PRD for your patent‑strength evaluation app, aligned to the layout and options shown in the screenshot, and centered on the idea: “user enters a patent number → app calculates strength and surfaces portfolio intelligence.”  

***

## 1. Product overview

The product is a web application that evaluates the **strength** of an individual patent and its surrounding portfolio using standardized patent‑quality indicators (citations, family size, claim scope, prior‑art density, litigation/invalidity risk, etc.). Users input a patent number, then get an AI‑generated strength score, risk alerts, and strategic recommendations in a command‑center style dashboard similar to the provided layout. [xlscout](https://xlscout.ai/all-you-need-to-know-about-patent-strength/)

***

## 2. Goals and non‑goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Enable IP teams, startups, and investors to quickly assess if a patent is strong, average, or weak for enforcement, licensing, or investment decisions. [patentest](https://patentest.com/4-effective-methods-for-patent-evaluation/)
- Provide a portfolio‑level view that aggregates scores into “workstreams” (e.g., technology themes, product lines, clients) and tracks progress of evaluation activities over time. [patentskart](https://patentskart.com/ip-analytics-dynamic-dashboard/)
- Surface actionable insights such as risky patents (high invalidity exposure), high‑value patents (strong citations and claim scope), and white‑space opportunities. [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157723000317)

### 2.2 Non‑goals (v1)

- No full‑fledged prior‑art search UI; use external patent databases via API for raw data.  
- No legal opinion generation or replacement for attorney work; outputs are decision support only.  
- No full financial valuation model beyond simple indicators (e.g., licensing potential score).

## 6. Patent‑strength scoring model (functional requirements)

The scoring engine is central; it must use a combination of known patent‑quality indicators. [xlscout](https://xlscout.ai/all-you-need-to-know-about-patent-strength/)

### 6.1 Input data

- Bibliographic data: filing date, priority date, jurisdictions, assignee, inventors, IPC/CPC codes. [sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751157723000317)
- Citation data: backward and forward citations, non‑patent literature references. [patsnap](https://www.patsnap.com/resources/blog/articles/patent-quality-assessment-guide/)
- Claim metrics: number of independent and dependent claims, length, and estimated breadth. [patsnap](https://www.patsnap.com/resources/blog/articles/patent-quality-assessment-guide/)
- Family information: family size, geographic spread, continuation/divisional structure. [xray.greyb](https://xray.greyb.com/intellectual-property/patent-scoring-and-rating)
- Legal status and events: grants, rejections, oppositions, litigation records, maintenance/renewal. [xlscout](https://xlscout.ai/assessing-patent-strength-with-ai-patent-invalidity-search/)
- Technology and market context (optional in v1): tech trend score, assignee strength, market growth proxies. [cimphony](https://www.cimphony.ai/insights/what-are-the-10-ai-tools-to-streamline-ip-portfolio-management)

### 6.2 Core strength dimensions

For each patent, derive subscores (0–100) and composite Strength Score:

1. **Novelty & non‑obviousness** – density and closeness of prior art, missed prior patents, and distinctive claim elements. [law.berkeley](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/files/wright.pdf)
2. **Citation power** – forward citation count, quality of citing assignees, and citation network centrality. [xlscout](https://xlscout.ai/all-you-need-to-know-about-patent-strength/)
3. **Claim robustness** – breadth vs clarity, number of independent claims, extent of narrowing amendments in prosecution history. [greyb](https://greyb.com/blog/patent-strength-check-for-litigation/)
4. **Family and coverage** – number of jurisdictions, alignment with high‑value markets, and protection of key products. [patentskart](https://patentskart.com/ip-analytics-dynamic-dashboard/)
5. **Legal risk** – invalidity risk (prior‑art conflicts), pending oppositions, litigation outcomes, and maintenance behavior. [deepip](https://www.deepip.ai/blog/ai-patent-portfolio-management)
6. **Strategic fit** – alignment with targeted workstreams (e.g., Grid storage strategy) and contribution to portfolio differentiation. [signicent](https://signicent.com/patview-patent-dashboard/)

Composite Strength Score is a weighted sum with configurable weights per client or portfolio. [xray.greyb](https://xray.greyb.com/intellectual-property/patent-scoring-and-rating)

### 6.3 Output indicators per patent

- Strength Score (0–100) – headline metric displayed as number and color band.  
- Risk Level (Low/Medium/High) – from legal risk subscore.  
- Confidence score (%) – reflects data completeness and model stability.  
- Value proxy – qualitative class (Low/Medium/High) or approximate monetary band based on income/market methods. [patentest](https://patentest.com/4-effective-methods-for-patent-evaluation/)
- Key drivers – list of top positive and negative factors (e.g., “High forward citations from major competitors”, “Narrow claims due to prosecution amendments”). [patsnap](https://www.patsnap.com/resources/blog/articles/patent-quality-assessment-guide/)
- Recommended action – keep/strengthen, license, prune, or monitor.
